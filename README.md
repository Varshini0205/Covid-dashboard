DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
COVID-19 Dashboard is an interactive web app built with Streamlit that lets users explore and compare COVID-19 data across countries. It provides daily and cumulative stats like confirmed cases, deaths, active cases, and case fatality rates, along with visualizations like line charts, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps. Users can filter by date and country, download data, and get insights in a simple, easy-to-use interface.

This repository contains the code for my Streamlit COVID-19 dashboard app.

You can try the live Streamlit app here: https://covid-dashboard-j8sthme42d6tefuqhdutly.streamlit.app/
